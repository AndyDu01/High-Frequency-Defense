# High Frequency Defense
Search for methods to train robust model on image task with low cost against gradient-based attacks.
- Main ideas
    - Attack on CNN is proved to be proning toward high frequency component(HFC) [ref](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_High-Frequency_Component_Helps_Explain_the_Generalization_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf). We wonder if it is possible to train model that focus more on low frequency, but retain the ability to utilize high frequency component(i.e. avoid truncating HFC component directly). There are few ideas on going:
        - High frequency noice
            - Randomly select a image from training set, extrating its HFC, and add onto other training image.
            - By doing so, we want our models to filter out the non-robust HFC that result in mis-classification.
        - High frequency with dynamic weight cross entropy loss
            - Addtional to adding noise, we try to directly hint models about the HFC that was added onto the image by magnifying the loss on HFC's class.
        - High frequency with auxiliary training
            - Instead of giving hint by loss function, we think it is feasible to make models recognize the class of HFC before it reaches the last layer. Thus, model structures like Inception-v3, GoogleNet were considered. However, result of the expriment indicate that it is probably not the way to go. One heuristic idea is that if a model's first section can tell the class of HFC, than it must be as strong as normal image classifier.
            - After the trial above, we refer to  ArchipLab's auxiliary training architecture, by swapping the natural image corruption with our high frequency noise image transformation.
